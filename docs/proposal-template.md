# Introduction

Our concept for our project is to have a working web application that is oriented around a business of some sort. We want our project to be practical and be able to use it as a nice accomplishment for job applications. 
The website will include an employee login where employees of various roles can login. Employees will be able to login and employees with the management role will be able to create/assign new jobs along with adding new employees. Normal employees will then be able to see their current jobs assigned to them along with their hours and estimated pay. The login will have to talk to an SQL database and employees will need to be able to change their password if needed. 


# Anticipated Technologies

We will need to be able to write in C#, we will need to use the microsoft .NET framework specifically asp.net,
coding in visual studio, we will need a SQL database in the back end to hold the information on the website,
and maybe a server to host the website.

# Method/Approach

We Plan to use agile scrum. Each week we will decide what needs to be completed and from there decide what we want to
work on individually. We may use Trello. 


# Estimated Timeline

2 Week Intervals - Will be broken down into a weekly timeline.

9/27/2021 - 10/11/2021: Get website format created and launched. 
10/11/2021 - 10/25/2021: Create SQL database and begin working on login/database.
10/25/2021 - 11/8/2021: Finish Login and begin working on employee databases and roles.
11/8/2021 - 11/22/2021: Finish backend, create employee “role”  pages, and begin testing.
11/22/2021 - 12/7/2021: Test, Test, and practice presentation. 

# Anticipated Problems

-Learning C# may be a challenge even though it does look similar to java. 
-This is something none of us have really done before so it will be a learning curve for all of us.
-Writing HTML code that actually looks nice.
-Setting up a SQL database server in the back end, also making the website public.
